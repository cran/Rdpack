Changes in Version 0.4-1
   - new major feature: processing references from Bibtex files.
     The top user level function is rebib(),  which updates
     section "references" in an Rd file. promptPackageSexpr() has
     been updated to use this feature. inspect_Rdbib() can be used
     in programming.

   - new auxiliary functions for work with bibentry objects.

   - new convenience programming functions for Rd objects.

   - some small bug fixes.

   - some gaps in the documentation filled.


Changes in Version 0.3-11

   - reprompt() did not handle properly S4 replacement methods. Changed the parsing of the
     arguments to rectify this. Some other functions also needed correction to handle this.

Changes in Version 0.3-10

   - Depends field in DESCRIPTION file updated to require R 2.15.0 or later.
     (because of a few uses of paste0() in recent code.)

Changes in Version 0.3-8

   - first public version
